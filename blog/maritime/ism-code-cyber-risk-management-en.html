    <p style="font-size: 1.15rem; color: var(--text-primary); line-height: 2;">
      Since January 2021, the ISM Code has required all shipping companies to address cyber risks in their safety management systems. But what does this actually mean in practice? This guide breaks down the requirements and provides actionable steps for compliance.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding the Requirement</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>IMO Resolution MSC.428(98)</strong> amended the ISM Code to explicitly include cyber risk management. The key phrase is that companies must now address cyber risks "appropriately" within their SMS (Safety Management System).
    </p>
    <p>
      This isn't about preventing all cyber incidents—that's impossible. Instead, it's about demonstrating that you have a systematic approach to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identifying cyber vulnerabilities in your fleet</li>
      <li>Assessing the risk each vulnerability poses</li>
      <li>Implementing appropriate safeguards</li>
      <li>Maintaining evidence of ongoing management</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Five Pillars of ISM Cyber Compliance</h2>

    <h3>1. Risk Assessment</h3>
    <p>
      Start by identifying all systems onboard that could be affected by cyber incidents. This isn't just IT systems—it includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Navigation equipment (ECDIS, GPS, AIS)</li>
      <li>Engine management systems</li>
      <li>Cargo handling systems</li>
      <li>Communication systems (VSAT, email)</li>
      <li>Administrative systems (crew management, procurement)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For each system, document potential cyber threats and their impact on safety, operations, and compliance.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Protection Measures</h3>
    <p>
      Based on your risk assessment, implement appropriate safeguards. The key word is "appropriate"—measures should be proportional to the risk. Common protections include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access controls and password policies</li>
      <li>Network segmentation (isolating critical systems)</li>
      <li>Regular software updates and patch management</li>
      <li>Backup procedures for critical data</li>
      <li>Physical security for system access points</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      "The most common ISM audit finding isn't weak technology—it's the inability to prove that cyber risks are actively managed as part of daily operations."
    </blockquote>

    <h3>3. Detection and Response</h3>
    <p>
      Your SMS must include procedures for <strong>detecting</strong> potential cyber incidents and <strong>responding</strong> when they occur. This means:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Monitoring systems for anomalies</li>
      <li>Clear escalation procedures when something looks wrong</li>
      <li>Documented response plans for common scenarios</li>
      <li>Communication protocols with shore management</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Recovery and Continuity</h3>
    <p>
      Auditors will ask: "What happens if your primary navigation system is compromised?" You need documented procedures for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Isolating affected systems</li>
      <li>Switching to backup systems or manual operations</li>
      <li>Restoring systems from known-good backups</li>
      <li>Verifying system integrity before returning to service</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Training and Awareness</h3>
    <p>
      All crew members must understand cyber risks relevant to their roles. This doesn't mean making everyone a cybersecurity expert—it means ensuring they know:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Common cyber threats (phishing, USB malware, etc.)</li>
      <li>Their role in protecting systems</li>
      <li>Who to contact if they suspect an incident</li>
      <li>Basic security practices (passwords, email safety)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Auditors Actually Look For</h2>
    <p>
      Based on recent ISM audits, here's what typically gets scrutinized:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Evidence of ongoing management:</strong> Not just having a policy, but showing regular reviews, updates, and crew involvement</li>
      <li><strong>Integration with existing SMS:</strong> Cyber risk should be part of your existing risk management, not a separate bolt-on</li>
      <li><strong>Vessel-specific considerations:</strong> Generic policies don't cut it—show that you've considered each vessel's unique systems</li>
      <li><strong>Incident tracking:</strong> Records of cyber-related incidents, near-misses, and lessons learned</li>
      <li><strong>Proof of training:</strong> Records showing all crew have received appropriate cyber awareness training</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>
    <p>
      Many companies fail audits not because of weak cybersecurity, but because of poor documentation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No evidence trail:</strong> Having good practices but no records to prove them</li>
      <li><strong>One-time exercise:</strong> Creating documents once but never updating them</li>
      <li><strong>Shore-centric approach:</strong> Policies written for shore office without considering vessel reality</li>
      <li><strong>Over-complexity:</strong> Creating systems so complex that crew can't actually follow them</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practical Implementation Steps</h2>
    <p>
      If you're starting from scratch, here's a realistic 90-day implementation path:
    </p>

    <p><strong>Days 1-30: Assessment</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Document all onboard systems and their cyber exposure</li>
      <li>Conduct risk assessment for each vessel type</li>
      <li>Identify gaps in current procedures</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Days 31-60: Implementation</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Update SMS documentation to include cyber risks</li>
      <li>Develop or update response procedures</li>
      <li>Deploy initial protective measures</li>
      <li>Create training materials</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Days 61-90: Verification</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Conduct crew training sessions</li>
      <li>Test response procedures with tabletop exercises</li>
      <li>Complete first cycle of documentation</li>
      <li>Schedule internal audit</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      ISM Code cyber risk management is fundamentally about demonstrating accountability. It's not about achieving perfect security—it's about showing that you have a systematic, ongoing approach to managing cyber risks within your SMS.
    </p>
    <p>
      The companies that pass audits most easily are those that integrate cyber risk into their existing safety management processes, rather than treating it as a separate compliance checkbox.
