<h3>15.1 Nature and Limitations of Services</h3>
<ol>
<li>The Services are information services that assess the security status of your systems and provide improvement recommendations. <strong>They do not guarantee complete security.</strong></li>
<li>Assessments are performed only on domains, IP addresses, and systems explicitly designated by you. You warrant that the assessment targets are under your ownership or control.</li>
